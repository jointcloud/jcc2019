The first-generation cloud (referred\nto as Cloud 1.0 in this proposal) mainly focuses on aggregating\nlarge-scale IT resources into a single cloud and providing well-managed,\nauto-provisioned resources and services. In Cloud 1.0, various forms of\ncomputing paradigms, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),\nPlatform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), have\nachieved remarkable.  However, there has recently been new challenges\nemerging to cloud computing. First, globalized ecommerce has largely\nredefined the requirements on cloud computing, and more collaboration is\nrequired between individual clouds due to service combination and\nlocation-sensitive computation. Second, many cloud-based businesses are\nexperiencing a burst of computation. For example, events like \u201cNovember\n11\u201d and \u201cBlack Friday\u201d usually require over 10x more resources than\ndaily operations, creating exhausted pressure to any single cloud\nprovider. Finally, the emerging big data and blockchain applications\nhave brought great challenges to cloud computing performance and\nprovider-cross service collaborations. In this scenario, not only the\nperformance and ease-of-use, but also the trustworthiness of the\nservices is highly urged.\n\n\nTo address these challenges, both academia and industry have started to\nconsider the federation and collaboration between individual clouds\n(referred to as Cloud 2.0). The key feature of Cloud\n2.0 is to eliminate the barrier among multiple clouds via joint cloud\ncomputing. For example, researchers from Europe have coined the concept\nof SuperCloud to enable cross-cloud computation migration. Cisco\nadvocates their Intercloud Fabric to enable transparent communication\nacross clouds. Chinese researchers have proposed \nInternet-based virtual\ncomputing environment (iVCE)\n to provide harmonious, trustworthy and\ntransparent integrated services based on open infrastructures across\nmultiple datacenters and cloud providers. Researchers have also explored\nthe economy of various resource prices in different clouds to save the\ncost by using cost-aware cross- cloud services.  \n\n\nJoint cloud computing\n (\nJointCloud\n) \n\n\nThe workshop on Joint Cloud Computing aims to provision an effective pathway for researchers and practitioners to share and discuss the state of the arts and new ideas in terms of joint cloud computing (aka. JointCloud). JointCloud is a new generation of computing model beyond Cloud 2.0 which facilitates developers to customize cross-cloud services through software-defined integration and cooperation among different cloud service entities. The main objective of the workshop is to: 1) investigate theories and mechanisms of cross-cloud resource abstraction, representation, and aggregation; 2) design and implement platform-level solutions and infrastructures (computation, storage and networking) to underpin the joint cloud execution environments; 3) explore innovative applications that leverage emerging techniques such as deep learning and block chain to provision intelligent and reliable JointCloud services. Compared against previous efforts in Cloud 2.0, the philosophy of JointCloud not only focuses on the vertical orchestration of cloud resources but reinforces horizontal cooperation among cloud vendors in the form of service-oriented computing paradigm.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nThe previous edition of the workshop (2009-2015) is named \"Internet-based Virtual Computing Environment\u201d (iVCE).
