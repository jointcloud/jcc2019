# Introduction to Joint Cloud Computing

## Background

Cloud computing holds the promise of “computing as a utility”, where
users can access services from everywhere in a “pay-as-you-go” fashion.
Enabled by cloud computing, developers are no longer required to
purchase and maintain hardware to deploy their software and services,
which has rapidly changed the IT industry and shaped the way how
software is designed and delivered. The first-generation cloud (referred
to as Cloud 1.0 in this proposal) mainly focuses on aggregating
large-scale IT resources into a single cloud and providing well-managed,
auto-provisioned resources and services. In Cloud 1.0, various forms of
computing paradigms, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), have
achieved remarkable.  However, there has recently been new challenges
emerging to cloud computing. First, globalized ecommerce has largely
redefined the requirements on cloud computing, and more collaboration is
required between individual clouds due to service combination and
location-sensitive computation. Second, many cloud-based businesses are
experiencing a burst of computation. For example, events like “November
11” and “Black Friday” usually require over 10x more resources than
daily operations, creating exhausted pressure to any single cloud
provider. Finally, the emerging big data and blockchain applications
have brought great challenges to cloud computing performance and
provider-cross service collaborations. In this scenario, not only the
performance and ease-of-use, but also the trustworthiness of the
services is highly urged.

To address these challenges, both academia and industry have started to
consider the federation and collaboration between individual clouds
(referred to as Cloud 2.0). The key feature of Cloud
2.0 is to eliminate the barrier among multiple clouds via joint cloud
computing. For example, researchers from Europe have coined the concept
of SuperCloud to enable cross-cloud computation migration. Cisco
advocates their Intercloud Fabric to enable transparent communication
across clouds. Chinese researchers have proposed **Internet-based virtual
computing environment (iVCE)** to provide harmonious, trustworthy and
transparent integrated services based on open infrastructures across
multiple datacenters and cloud providers. Researchers have also explored
the economy of various resource prices in different clouds to save the
cost by using cost-aware cross- cloud services.  

**Joint cloud computing** (a.k.a. **JointCloud**) is a new generation of
computing model for Cloud 2.0, which facilitates developers to customize
cross-cloud services by means of “software definition” based on the
integration and cooperation among cloud service entities. The goal of
the workshop for JointCloud is to investigate theories and methods of
abstracting and aggregating cross-cloud resources, building integrated
virtual private clouds, as well as exploring novel applications that
leverage JointCloud. Compared to previous efforts in the category of
Cloud 2.0, JointCloud not only focuses on a vertical integration of
cloud resources but also expects a horizontal cooperation between cloud
providers in the form of service-oriented computing.
