# IEEE JCC 2019 Call For Papers

Established in 2009, JCC has increasingly been a major workshop for researchers and engineers to exchange 
new ideas and results regarding distributed and parallel systems such as cluster resource management system, 
virtualized techniques, big data processing, fault-tolerant system design and implementation, etc.
The 10th IEEE International Joint Cloud Computing Workshop (JCC 2019)
will be held in San Francisco, USA, April, 2019. 



## Topics of Interest

This workshop aims at soliciting innovative research findings in joint
cloud computing. Topics of interest for technical papers include, but
are not limited to: 

* Resource management and scheduling in joint cloud computing
* Architecture, infrastructure, economics for joint cloud computing
* Cloud-crossing virtualization, interaction and collaboration
* Reliability, availability, consistency, trust and security of joint cloud computing 
* Big data processing algorithms and platforms
* Blockchain technologies and applications for reliable service provisioning
* Low cost communication and networking for joint cloud computing
* System monitoring, fault diagnosis and fault tolerance in joint cloud computing
* Machine learning based system optimisation for improved efficiency of joint cloud computing

## Paper Submission Guidelines

All papers need to be submitted electronically using the EasyChair
conference system with PDF format. The materials presented in the papers
should not be published or under submission elsewhere. Each paper is
suggested to have not more than 6 pages including figures and references using
IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscripts style (two columns,
single-spaced, 10 fonts). You can confirm the IEEE Computer Society
Proceedings Author Guidelines at the following web page:

For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors should be
registered and present the paper on the workshop. The paper will be
included in the conference proceedings and will be submitted for
inclusion to **IEEE Xplore** as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I)
databases.
