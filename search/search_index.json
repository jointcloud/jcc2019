The first-generation cloud (referred\nto as Cloud 1.0 in this proposal) mainly focuses on aggregating\nlarge-scale IT resources into a single cloud and providing well-managed,\nauto-provisioned resources and services. In Cloud 1.0, various forms of\ncomputing paradigms, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),\nPlatform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), have\nachieved remarkable.  However, there has recently been new challenges\nemerging to cloud computing. First, globalized ecommerce has largely\nredefined the requirements on cloud computing, and more collaboration is\nrequired between individual clouds due to service combination and\nlocation-sensitive computation. Second, many cloud-based businesses are\nexperiencing a burst of computation. For example, events like \u201cNovember\n11\u201d and \u201cBlack Friday\u201d usually require over 10x more resources than\ndaily operations, creating exhausted pressure to any single cloud\nprovider. Finally, the emerging big data and blockchain applications\nhave brought great challenges to cloud computing performance and\nprovider-cross service collaborations. In this scenario, not only the\nperformance and ease-of-use, but also the trustworthiness of the\nservices is highly urged.\n\n\nTo address these challenges, both academia and industry have started to\nconsider the federation and collaboration between individual clouds\n(referred to as Cloud 2.0). The key feature of Cloud\n2.0 is to eliminate the barrier among multiple clouds via joint cloud\ncomputing. For example, researchers from Europe have coined the concept\nof SuperCloud to enable cross-cloud computation migration. Cisco\nadvocates their Intercloud Fabric to enable transparent communication\nacross clouds. Chinese researchers have proposed \nInternet-based virtual\ncomputing environment (iVCE)\n to provide harmonious, trustworthy and\ntransparent integrated services based on open infrastructures across\nmultiple datacenters and cloud providers. Researchers have also explored\nthe economy of various resource prices in different clouds to save the\ncost by using cost-aware cross- cloud services.  \n\n\nJoint cloud computing\n (a.k.a. \nJointCloud\n) is a new generation of\ncomputing model for Cloud 2.0, which facilitates developers to customize\ncross-cloud services by means of \u201csoftware definition\u201d based on the\nintegration and cooperation among cloud service entities. The goal of\nthe workshop for JointCloud is to investigate theories and methods of\nabstracting and aggregating cross-cloud resources, building integrated\nvirtual private clouds, as well as exploring novel applications that\nleverage JointCloud. Compared to previous efforts in the category of\nCloud 2.0, JointCloud not only focuses on a vertical integration of\ncloud resources but also expects a horizontal cooperation between cloud\nproviders in the form of service-oriented computing. \n\n\nHistory\n\n\nThe previous edition of the workshop (2009-2015) is called \u201cWorkshop on\nInternet-based Virtual Computing Environment\u201d (iVCE).
